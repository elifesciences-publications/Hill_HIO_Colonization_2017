 \caption*{\textbf{Figure 1 - Supplement 3. } \textbf{A} Schematic representation of the microinjection of HIOs with live \textit{E. coli}. See Materials and Methods for additional details. \textbf{B} A comparison of CFU/HIO at 24 h post-microinjection of HIOs microinjected with \num{10e3} CFU live \textit{E. coli} diluted in sterile PBS or fresh LB broth. \textit{N} = 5 HIOs per condition. All experiments presented in the main paper represent \textit{E. coli} diluted in PBS. \textit{C} To test for the effect of antibiotic carryover of \textit{E. coli} growth in the HIO lumen, we compared CFU/HIO in HIOs cultured in antibiotic free media ("Remove abx") or media containing penicillin and streptomycin at 24 h post-microinjection with \num{e3} CFU live \textit{E. coli}. All experiments presented in the main paper represent HIOs cultured in antibiotic-free media due to the apparent effect of antibiotics in suppressing \textit{E. coli} growth within the HIO lumen. \textit{N} = 5 HIOs per condition. \textit{D} In several experiments, bacterial translocation was measured by samplign the external HIO culture media (Figures 1 and 8). To evaluate the potential influence of antibiotic carryover in our estimates of bacterial translocation, we measured growth inhibition in \textit{E. coli} cultures plated as a lawn of LB agar and treated with 1 $\mu$l samples of HIO media collected during the 1 h antibiotic wash step or after HIO culture washout with PBS and replacement with fresh antibiotic free media (see panel A). \textit{N} = 6 replicates per culture condition. All \textit{P}-values represent the results of unpaired one-tailed Student's \textit{t}-test comparisons.}
