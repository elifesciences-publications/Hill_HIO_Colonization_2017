 \caption*{\textbf{Figure 5 - Supplement 1. } \textbf{A} Heatmap representation of time-dependent normalized RNA-seq gene expression for NF-$\kappa$B pathway components in HIOs at 0-96 h post-microinjection. \textbf{B} Western blot of phosphorylated p65 and total p65 in cell lysates from HIOs microinjected with PBS or live \textit{E. coli} and treated with IKK$\beta$ inhibitor SC-514 (1 $\mu$M) as indicated in the figure. \textbf{C} log2-transformed fold-change in gene expression relative to PBS-injected controls for all 7 experimental conditions examined in this set of experiments: live E. coli +/- SC-514, heat-killed E. coli +/- SC-514, and hypoxic culture +/- SC-514, and PBS + SC-514. Differentially expressed genes (adjusted FDR < 0.05) are indicated in red (up-regulated) or blue (down-regulated). Mean of 3 -5 replicates per experimental condition. \textbf{D} Top 10 percentile by FDR-adjusted \textit{P}-value of over-represented genes sets from the GO, KEGG, and REACTOME databases in genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by treatment with SC-514 alone relative to PBS-injected control HIOs. \textbf{E} (Copied from Figure 5 for ease of reference) Venn Diagram showing the number of genes shared between Gene Set I, Gene Set II, and the set of genes that are significantly down-regulated in PBS-injected HIOs treated with SC-514 relative to PBS-injected control HIOs. \textbf{F} Top 10 percentile by FDR-adjusted \textit{P}-value of  over-represented genes sets from the GO, KEGG, and REACTOME databases in genes that were shared between Gene Set I or II and the set of genes that are significantly down-regulated in HIOs treated with SC-514 relative to PBS-injected control HIOs.}
